The Odin Project
HTML Recipes Project: 
- This project is a basic recipe website displaying the dish names, some images and links to the actual recipes. 
  - Once I have completed this project, the skills that I would demonstrate include setting up an basic HTML boiler-plate, adding headings and paragraphs, as well as hyperlink references and imagess.
