    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bún bò Huế is a hidden Vietnamese gem that has yet to “make it” in
      mainstream American cuisine. It’s a rich and spicy soup with deep layers
      of flavor. This Central Vietnamese soup is paired with tender slices of
      beef and pork, then topped with lots of fresh herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bún bò Huế” literally translates to Huế beef noodle soup. The city of Huế
      was put on the map as Vietnam’s capital in 1802 when the Nguyen Dynasty
      seized control of the country and ruled from this central city.This city
      has a reputation for having spicy foods–not something as common with other
      Vietnamese cuisine. My mom believes there’s no real reason for it other
      than trying to boost flavor when there weren’t other options. Sounds kinda
      like what you hot sauce fiends out there do yeah?

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Broth</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Clean the meat: Add all meat to a stock pot and enough water to
          submerge it, bring to a boil. Drain and rinse thoroughly under running
          water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the meat, broth, lemongrass and onions to the pot and fill with
          water almost to the brim. Bring to a boil then drop the heat to
          medium-high to maintain a low boil. Add the seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let it simmer and periodically check the meats for doneness and remove
          them as they finish cooking. The pork should be done after about an
          hour, the beef can vary between 2-3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          After all the meat has removed, let it cool, then slice it. Adjust
          seasoning and add water to the broth pot if necessary.
