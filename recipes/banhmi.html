    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Originally designed as on-the-go street food, bánh mì is packed with
      flavor, a touch of fat balanced with light pickles, delicious and super
      affordable. When you can get it with fresh bread, it is unmatched. The
      Vietnamese bánh mì is a must-have for any sandwich lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vietnamese sandwich was influenced by French colonialism in Vietnam
      with French baguettes (much like Vietnamese coffee is), but the Vietnamese
      people have made this sandwich one of their own creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vietnamese bánh mì is a departure from our simple homemade white bread
      sandwiches, with more distinct and unique flavors than the typical
      american chain foot-long sandwiches. You get your crunchy crusty bread fix
      with savory meats, fatty and salty spreads, crunchy pickles to balance out
      the richness, and herbs for a tidy handheld meal loaded with flavor.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toast baguettes to warm, but not so crispy that they fall apart when you
        split them to add fillings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash all the veggies and slice to prep. Slicing with a mandoline will
        keep everything uniform.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut baguettes in half but leave the back part uncut so the loaf stays
        intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add mayo and/or pate to the bottom, then layer the meat and veggies to
        your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a few shakes of Maggi or soy sauce, and a few grinds of pepper to
        taste
      </li>
    </ol>
