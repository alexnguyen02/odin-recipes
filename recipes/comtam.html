    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Brunch is a big deal everywhere. In recent years, it’s become more of an
      event than a mash up of lunch and dinner. In Vietnamese culture, it’s no
      surprise that we have different ideas on what should be on a brunch menu.
      One dish that I’ve grown used to having not only for brunch but also for
      other meals is com suon. Com suon is a really popular rice dish in
      Vietnamese cuisine. It has lemongrass pork chops, broken rice garnished
      with mo hanh, fresh vegetables, pickled vegetables, and a fried egg, all
      served on one plate.

      Com is the Vietnamese word for rice. Rice is an important ingredient in
      Vietnam. Nearly every dish in Vietnamese cuisine involves rice in some
      way. One of the most common dishes involving rice is com tam. Com tam is a
      term used to describe the entire category of Vietnamese rice dishes made
      with broken rice. “Com” means rice and “tam” refers to the broken grains.
      Broken rice is rice that has been damaged during harvest or production. In
      the past, broken rice was hard to sell, so farmers used to throw it away
      or use it as animal feed. Eventually, farmers and poor families started
      consuming it because it was cheaper than normal rice which was how com tam
      originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plate of com tam has a protein, pickled vegetables like pickled carrots
      and daikon, slices of cucumber and/or tomatoes, sometimes cha trung hap,
      and of course a side of nuoc cham for dipping! There are a variety of com
      tam dishes. There’s Com Ga (rice plate with lemongrass chicken), Com Tom
      Cang Rim (rice plate with jumbo shrimp), and of course Com Suon Nuong
      (rice plate with grilled pork chops).
